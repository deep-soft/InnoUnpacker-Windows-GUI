### Inno Setup Unpacker - Windows GUI

#### Inspect and unpack InnoSetup archives

[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a popular program
for making software installations. To verify and get files out of the self-extracting 
executable, these open source console applications are available:

- Original version [Innounp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp) (can be used up to InnoSetup 6.1)
- Updated Unicode version [Innounp-1](innounp-1) (can be used up to InnoSetup 6.3)

**InnoUnpacker** is a graphical user interface (GUI) for these console applications
that makes the usage more comfortable.
The executable setup to be processed can be loaded via a file selection dialog, just 
by drag & drop, using the command line or by an entry in the Windows context menu for *exe* files. 
Immediately after opening, the basic file info of the setup is displayed. All other functions are activated by clicking on one of the buttons:

- A list of all included files 
- All supported languages 
- Verify setup file
- Start file extraction
- Select destination directory for extracted files

Optionally, a filter can be specified to extract only the matching files. A separate button is provided to only select the install script.
